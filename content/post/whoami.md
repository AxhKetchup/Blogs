# **whoami** 🧑‍💻  

Hey there! I'm Aayush—a command-line enthusiast, digital wanderer, and someone who believes life is best lived with a mix of `sudo privileges` and spontaneous `rm -rf comfort-zone/`.  

## **$ cat /etc/about_me**  
- 🖥️ **System Uptime**: Still running, but occasionally needs a reboot.  
- 🎯 **Current Focus**: Writing, breaking, and fixing things (in that order).  
- 🛠️ **Tech Stack**: A little bit of everything, from C++ and Rust to setting up obscure Linux configurations for fun.  
- 🚀 **Hobbies**: Climbing digital and literal mountains.  

## **$ ps aux | grep adventure**  
Life's a rolling release, and I’m just here applying patches as I go. Whether it’s setting up a new system, working on passion projects, or just getting lost in deep tech rabbit holes, I love exploring.  

This blog? It’s a log file of my experiences—tech, life, and the chaos in between. If you’re into problem-solving, digital tinkering, and a bit of storytelling, welcome aboard!
